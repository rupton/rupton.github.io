## Performance :runner:
 #### Caching
 [Caching Notes](:note:94549d73-5d47-42b6-a2db-0230882e93c5)
 Caching is still a concern. Allegis would like to know more about caching concerns like how it works, if it can be managed/controlled, what effects it may have on performance, etc.
 1. Get with Farid to see where we are on this vis-a-vis where we last left it.
 2. Review this is more detail [Caching Data with Storable Actions](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/developer-relations/2017/03/lightning-components-best-practices-caching-data-storable-actions.html).

- #### Technical Debt Backlog
 I still need to confirm with Erica if I can lead this one in Sudheers departure. Will need to work with tech leads especially Farid to review what items are slated for Lightning Component refactoring. Will also need to dive deeper into Lightning Web Components as possible solutions to some Lightning component technical debt.
